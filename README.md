# Modular Kitchen Management System
Our client, Dinakar Shetty owns the Sanjivini Home solutions, which a shop that has modular kitchen items and also designs a full kitchen. They store the data of customers in an excel sheet or registers and the details of the products, accessories that are available in their shop is stored in paper. This way of storing the important data is risky. Our approach to solve this problem was to create a database for the shop in which they can store the customer data, the products and accessories that are available in their shop and they can also easily be able to generate bills and receipt without actually manually writing the data.
